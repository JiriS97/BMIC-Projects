# BMIC Projects
This repository is a collection of programs written by me on BMIC lessons on BUT (VUT Brno in Czech).
These programs are written in Assembly/C, task description is included in each main file, when possible.
All projects are for MC9S08LH64 MCU (from the HCS08 family)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
To compile these projects yourself you will need CodeWarrior, you can get a free copy from NXP's website.
Some of the projects contain more than one main file, usually named main and mainB, that is because
the exercise had two parts, you need to exclude the file you don't need from build
(right click -> Resource configuration -> Exclude from build)
